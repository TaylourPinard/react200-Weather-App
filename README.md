# react200-Weather-App
React application to search the current weather conditions. It gets the results from the api at openweathermap.org.
The application also keeps track of your recent searches (if you don't close or reload the page) in a search history box.
To run the project after cloning it, navigate into the project directory, run "npm install", then run "npm run build",
lastly run "npm start" you should then be able to pull the project up in your browser at localhost:3000. Or if you just want
to see it running I have it hosted at https://taylourp-react200-weather-app.herokuapp.com/
